# Step 28 — Admin: promotions, CMS, reports + Vendor portal

> Detail card for the Klara Home implementation plan.
> Tracker: [`../IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](../IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) · Parking Lot: [`../PARKING_LOT.md`](../PARKING_LOT.md) · Test debt: [`../TEST_DEBT.md`](../TEST_DEBT.md)

> **MVP BUILD SPRINT STEP.** Build first, test last - see
> [`../IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](../IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) section 3 before starting. Write
> production code; do not write integration tests. Record every deferred test in
> [`../TEST_DEBT.md`](../TEST_DEBT.md).

- **Phase:** G · **Depends on:** Step 27
- **Objective:** Merchandising, analytics, and the vendor-facing experience.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Promotions: coupon and cart-rule builder with live preview/simulator, scheduling,
    usage analytics.
  - CMS: page composer UI with block library, drag-order, preview, scheduling, version history,
    menu/banner/collection management, redirect and SEO tools.
  - Reports dashboards (placeholder-styled charts only; visual polish deferred to Step 30).
  - Vendor portal (same app, vendor-scoped roles): onboarding/KYC, listings, inventory,
    orders and dispatch, returns, ledger and settlement statements, performance metrics.
  - Platform administration: users/roles, vendors, commission plans, settings, feature flags,
    tax rates, shipping zones, audit log.
- **Build acceptance - what closes this step during the sprint:**
  1. Every item under **Deliverables** is written: entities, configuration, handlers, endpoints,
     module registration and DI wiring, and the EF migration for this module.
  2. The code compiles - `dotnet build src/backend/KlaraHome.sln` (backend) or
     `npx nx build <app>` (frontend) succeeds with no errors.
  3. The endpoints are registered and declare their permissions; the module is referenced by the
     host, and the migrator project compiles with the new migration.
  4. Every behaviour named in the full acceptance criteria below that has not been proved has a
     row in [`../TEST_DEBT.md`](../TEST_DEBT.md).
  5. Outcome / Notes filled in, Parking Lot updated, permission requested.
- **Full acceptance criteria (verified at Step 29, not now):** A vendor completes a full day's operations in the portal; a
  merchandiser publishes a campaign (coupon + banner + collection) without engineering help.
- **Outcome / Notes:** _(to be filled on completion)_
