# Step 17 — Returns, Refunds & RMA module

> Detail card for the Klara Home implementation plan.
> Tracker: [`../IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](../IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) · Parking Lot: [`../PARKING_LOT.md`](../PARKING_LOT.md) · Test debt: [`../TEST_DEBT.md`](../TEST_DEBT.md)

> **MVP BUILD SPRINT STEP.** Build first, test last - see
> [`../IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](../IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) section 3 before starting. Write
> production code; do not write integration tests. Record every deferred test in
> [`../TEST_DEBT.md`](../TEST_DEBT.md).

- **Phase:** D · **Depends on:** Step 16
- **Objective:** The post-delivery lifecycle, which for Indian marketplaces is a first-class flow.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Return/replacement request with reason codes, evidence images, eligibility window from
    policy configuration (per category / vendor).
  - RMA state machine (Requested → Approved/Rejected → Pickup Scheduled → Picked → In Transit
    → Received → QC Passed/Failed → Refunded/Replaced/Closed).
  - Reverse pickup via logistics provider; QC disposition and restock-or-scrap decision.
  - Refund orchestration: original payment method via Razorpay, or store credit; partial
    refunds including proportional tax and shipping treatment; credit note generation.
  - Customer-cancelled-after-dispatch (RTO) handling.
- **Build acceptance - what closes this step during the sprint:**
  1. Every item under **Deliverables** is written: entities, configuration, handlers, endpoints,
     module registration and DI wiring, and the EF migration for this module.
  2. The code compiles - `dotnet build src/backend/KlaraHome.sln` (backend) or
     `npx nx build <app>` (frontend) succeeds with no errors.
  3. The endpoints are registered and declare their permissions; the module is referenced by the
     host, and the migrator project compiles with the new migration.
  4. Every behaviour named in the full acceptance criteria below that has not been proved has a
     row in [`../TEST_DEBT.md`](../TEST_DEBT.md).
  5. Outcome / Notes filled in, Parking Lot updated, permission requested.
- **Full acceptance criteria (verified at Step 29, not now):** A delivered line can be returned, picked up, QC'd and refunded with
  a correct credit note and stock adjustment.
- **Outcome / Notes:** _(to be filled on completion)_
